# Getting started

This is documentation for code written as part of the manuscript ["Data-driven fine-grained region discovery in the mouse brain with transformers"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.05.592608v1). 

## Installation

* `pip install git+github.com:abbasilab/celltransformer.git` or clone and pip install; alternatively use the Dockerfile, which uses `uv` to reduce build time.

## Getting started with training on different datasets

Requirements are a CSV file with cell types and cell IDs corresponding to an `anndata` object with probe counts. To set these up for use with the code in this repo:

1. make sure you provide the right cardinality (number of cell types) to the model using the `model` config. You can also do this using the `hydra` CLI by just passing (say you want to change the parameter `cell_cardinality` in the your `model.yaml` file): `python [SCRIPT.PY] +model.cell_cardinality=9000` (or whatever the value is)
2. the code right now unfortunately assumes that the values in your anndata.X are `log1p` transformed and then uses `.exp()` in the implementation (`training/lightning_model.py`) to produce counts again for `scvi.NegativeBinomial` -- make sure you follow this convention or edit the training file for a different convention.

To see a minimal example of this please see `notebooks/demo_celltransformer_onesection.ipynb`.

### I want to edit the anndata (MERFISH probe counts) and CSV (cell metadata) to work with this codebase

1. Provide in your CSV (case sensitive):

	| column name | description |
	|----------|----------|
	| `cell_type`   | integer encoded class label for the cell type of a given cell   |
	| `cell_label`     | value that will be used to index the `anndata` object. Make sure it is of appropriate datatype because we do not perform any transformation on it (such as conversion to str or int) prior to indexing the `anndata` object. |
	| `brain_section_label`   | value that we will `.groupby()` on to select individual tissue sections to get the cells |
	| `x` | spatial coordinate that will be used to identify neighbors. Must be in same units as `patch_size` argument (default in `hydra` configs is micron). | 
	| `y` | similar as `x` | 

2. Change paths in the `hydra` config file template (`scripts/config/data/mouse1.yaml`). If you do not do this, the script will almost certainly not work.
3. Make sure value of `patch_size` fits your `x` and `y` created in step (1) in the same YAML file.
4. Adjust model parameters in `scripts/config/model/` for desired model, or adjust at runtime using `hydra` composition (see [hydra docs](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/#:~:text=Hydra%20is%20an%20open-source)). 
5. Set `config_path` in `hydra.main` decorator to the path and config file of interest (see template file `scripts/training/train_base.py`).
6. Set up `wandb` parameters in `scripts/training/train_base.py`.
7. Run with `python train_base.py`.

### I want to edit this at the hydra config level or in the starter script (or just want to better understand the above)

1. Hydra config file setup: change data paths in `config/data` or create new data yaml file in that folder that has the same fields as the examples in that directory. Make sure to specify:
	- `celltype_colname`: the column that gives the cell type of the cells in the dataset (if you are templating from the `train_aibs_mouse.py` file, which we recommend, we will use `sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder` on this column in the base `train_aibs_mouse.py` file, so it doesn't matter if it's integer or string encoded. If you are not using that function, make sure the dataframe you pass to `CenterMaskSampler` has column `cell_type` (case sensitive default argument) which *must* integer encoded.)
		- NOTE: we are basically assuming you want to train on one mouse, so if there are multiple and there is a chance that one mouse out of multiple has some cell types that are not shared, you need to separately fit the LabelEncoder and then provide integer-encoded class labels (see `train_zhuang.py` for an example.)
	- `cell_id_colname`: the column that gives an ID that we can use to lookup into the h5ad file for single cells' probe count profiles. Make sure this is of the same datatype as the row ID's in the `anndata` object (i.e. make sure that the ID isn't 12345: uint | int instead of 12345: str). 
2. specify model architecture (depth, width etc.) configs in `config/model` yaml file
3. implement the `load_data` method for `BaseTrainer` in `scripts/training/lightning_model.py` (see `train_zhuang.py` and `train_aibs_mouse.py` for reference)
	- in essence this is normalization: mapping spatial x and y coordinates in your data to "x" and "y" and scaling them, also normalizing cell type column names as described in (1), optionally. One example might be to filter control probes. 
		- specifically you can look at `load_data` in `train_aibs_mouse` to see an example, but the dataloader code assumes that the spatial columns are `x` and `y`. 
		- we also don't automatically rescale the units of the `x` and `y` columns relative to the `patch_size` arguments. The idea is for the user to correctly scaled versions and to use code in `scripts/training/lightning_model.py:BaseTrainer.load_data` to set up the data loader with the logic you need for your data, and then pass a version of that to `celltransformer.data.CenterMaskSampler`
	- for more information on the data and dataloader, see the [data + dataloader page](data.md)
  * alternatively just change the `data.patch_size` config value in `hydra` (see `scripts/config/data/`); as long as the desired patch size and spatial units in the dataframe are correctly scaled, then it will work
4. add `wandb` project if desired to top level config in `config`
5. copy boilerplate for initiating training from `train_aibs_mouse.py` or `train_zhuang.py` (ie code in `main` that); make sure to specify correct config file in the `@hydra.main` decorator
	- for more information on this see the [`hydra` docs](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/).

The design of the dataloader object is:

1. Store the dataframe (with cell metadata including x/y coordinates, cell types (integer encoded), and the unique identifier (referred to throughout the codebase as cell label) for each cell that we will to index into the anndata, as well as section IDs/groupings) along with the anndata 
	* note there are some rudimentary checks to see if you have provided column names not found in the metadata dataframe. You do not need to have the metadata columns in the `anndata`
2. Receive the string valued column names of the same (x/y coordinates, cell type column, section ID/groupings) and use them to index into the dataframe
3. Store the cells corresponding to each column in a dictionary for later use (ie section_1: some_dataframe)
3. The high level of the __getitem__ is then to index the cell of interest (cell_i), lookup the neighbors based on the user-provided (see __init__ for the CellTransformer model object) spatial threshold parameter, and then produce a `namedtuple` (`NeighborMetadata`) that has as attributes:
	* `observed_expression`: a `numpy` array with dimensions (`n_cells` by `n_genes`)
	* `masked_expression`: a 1 by `n_genes` matrix
	* `masked_cell_type`: integer encoding for the cell type of the masked cell (cell_i)
	* `masked_expression`: a `n_cells` by `n_genes` matrix
	* `num_cells_obs`: number of masked cells
4. By default we will use the `celltransformer/data/loader_pandas.py:collate` function. It will loop over the list of `NeighborMetadata` and output a dictionary containing various concatenated data including the attention masks (keys `encoder_mask` and `pooling_mask`) to allow cells within neighborhoods to attend to each other across the batch and mask for attention pooling, respectively. See `forward` function of the CellTransformer model code to understand further operations.

## Core code components and usage

### Config management with hydra
The main interface to the training code we wrote is through `hydra` (https://hydra.cc/), which is a configuration framework that uses yaml files to orchestrate and organize complex workflows. Please see the [`hydra`](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) documentation for more information.

The pipeline controls the basic training operations through these yaml files and Pytorch Lightning.

For example, `scripts/config/model/base.yaml` controls the parameters of the transformer itself, for example:

```
_target_: celltransformer.model.CellTransformer
encoder_embedding_dim: 384
decoder_embedding_dim: 384

encoder_num_heads: 8
decoder_num_heads: 8
attn_pool_heads: 8

encoder_depth: 4
decoder_depth: 4

cell_cardinality: 384
eps: 1e-9

n_genes: 500
xformer_dropout: 0.0
bias: True
zero_attn: True
```

We can use hydra to directly instantiate this model (which we specify using the `_target_` attribute) by specifiying the object class, here `celltransformer.model.CellTransformer`. What this looks like in context is in following snippet:

```
cfg_path = 'config.yaml'
cfg = OmegaConf.load(cfg_path) # same as above snippet
model = hydra.utils.instantiate(cfg.model)

# model will have 500 gene output decoder depth of 4, etc. and will be an instance of class `celltransformer.model.CellTransformer`
```

### Composition of config files is controlled at top-level using another config

An example of this composition at high level is the `scripts/config/example.yaml` file, which contains the settings used to train on the Allen Institute for Brain Science MERFISH data in the [Allen Brain Cell Atlas](https://portal.brain-map.org/atlases-and-data/bkp/abc-atlas). Note that "mouse1.yaml" refers to a file inside the `config/data` directory. Correspondingly there is a `config/model/base.yaml` file that is specified by the below config, which is found one-level-up (ie in the `config` directory). 

```
defaults:
  - _self_
  - data: mouse1.yaml
  - model: base.yaml
  - optimization: base.yaml

checkpoint_dir: 
wandb_project: 
model_checkpoint: 
wandb_code_dir: 
```

Where you can see we can group and order config components and define several high level attributes such as the checkpoint directory. You may like, however, to change these. For example including `wandb_project` will assume you can `wandb.login()` (see the wandb website for information on wandb and how to get a free account) and set this as the project. 

The `wandb_code_dir` argument will be used later to log the specific code used. 

For some files, a field may read: `???` indicating that field must be filled or `hydra` will error. 

Overall, fields in config files are accessible as `.[attribute]` in the DictConfig (from Omegaconf) object for example `config.model.n_genes`.

Keep in mind that for dataset paths, all of them ought to be hardcoded in. Therefore, for datapaths in `config/data` these paths should be considered placeholders for you to fill in. I left in paths to explicitly indicate filepaths to the Zhuang and AIBS MERFISH data hosted on [https://allen-brain-cell-atlas.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/index.html](https://allen-brain-cell-atlas.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/index.html).

### Training on the AIBS MERFISH data

The entrypoint to the training used for the Allen Institute for Brain Science MERFISH dataset (mouse 6388550) is in `scripts/train_aibs_mouse.py`, which uses `scripts/config/aibs1.yaml`. To run the code (assuming the package has been installed):

1. download the data (use `scripts/download_aibs.sh`)
2. edit `config/data/mouse1.yaml`, specifically:
```
adata_path: './abc_dataset/C57BL6J-6388550-log2.h5ad'
metadata_path: './abc_dataset/cell_metadata_with_cluster_annotation.csv'
```
3. change whatever combination of checkpoint and `wandb` settings in `scripts/config/aibs1.yaml`
4. run the trainer script (`scripts/training/train_aibs_mouse.py`)

```
chmod +x scripts/download_aibs.sh
./scripts/download_aibs.sh
python scripts/training/train_aibs_mouse.py
```
